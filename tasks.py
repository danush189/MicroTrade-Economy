    description="""
    As a food producer, your job is to:
    
    1. Check your inventory and health: 
       - Use: Check Inventory (agent_id="producer")
       - Monitor your health - if below 70, prioritize using labor
    
    2. Check market for labor:
       - Use: View Market (agent_id="producer")
       - IMPORTANT: Hire labor when available at â‰¤2.0 currency per unit
       - Producing without labor costs 5 health points!
       - Use: Hire Labor (agent_id="producer", offer_id="offer_XXXX")
    
    3. Produce food strategically: 
       - Use: Produce Food (agent_id="producer", use_labor=True)  # Set use_labor=True when you have hired labor
       - Using labor increases production and prevents health loss
       - Without labor, you'll lose 5 health points per production
    
    4. Consume food to maintain your health: 
       - Use: Consume Food (agent_id="producer", good_name="food", quantity=1)
       - ALWAYS do this each cycle or your health will decrease
    
    5. Create offers to sell surplus food:
       - Use: Create Sell Offer (agent_id="producer", good_name="food", quantity=X, price=Y)
       - Keep 2-3 units in reserve (more if health is low)
       - Price based on production method: with labor (1.5-2.0), without labor (2.0-2.5)
    
    IMPORTANT PRIORITIES: 
    1. Maintain health above 70
    2. Use labor whenever possible
    3. Keep sufficient food reserves
    4. Sell surplus at fair prices
    
    Strategy Tips:
    - If health < 70: Focus on using labor and building reserves
    - If health > 70: Can produce without labor if needed
    - Price food higher when produced without labor (covers health cost)
    - Always check for labor offers before producing
    - Build emergency fund of 10-15 currency for labor hiring

       - Use: View Market (agent_id="market")
       - Track price trends and supply/demand
       - Identify agents in financial distress
    
    2. Price Stabilization:

         * When prices < 1.2: Prioritize higher-price sellers
    
    3. Match trades strategically:
       - Use: Match Market (agent_id="market")
       - Prioritize matching order:
         1. Emergency needs (agents with health < 50)
         2. Basic needs (agents with no food)
         3. Standard trades (regular supply/demand)
    
    4. Monitor system health:
       - Use: Check Inventory (agent_id="market")
       - Track fees collected
       - Monitor overall economic activity
    
    MARKET INTERVENTION GUIDELINES:
    - When food prices > 2.0:
      * Encourage producers to use labor (increases supply)
      * Prioritize matches for agents with low health
    
    - When multiple agents have low health:
      * Facilitate emergency food distribution
      * Enable price discounts for struggling agents
    
    - When labor market is stagnant:
      * Encourage producer-worker matches
      * Facilitate fair labor pricing
    
    IMPORTANT:
    - Your role is to maintain market stability
    - Prevent extreme price fluctuations
    - Ensure basic needs are met
    - Balance profit with social welfare
    
    Success Metrics:
    1. Stable food prices (1.0-2.5 range)

       - If health < 50 or currency < 10: Price at 1.2-1.5
       - Never price below 1.0 (minimum living wage)
    
    4. Offer your labor services:
       - Use: Offer Labor (agent_id="worker", target_agent_id="producer", labor_units=X, price_per_unit=Y)
       - Offer smaller quantities (2-3 units) when prices are high
       - Offer larger quantities (4-5 units) when prices are low
    
    5. Consume food to maintain health:
       - Use: Consume Food (agent_id="worker", good_name="food", quantity=1)
       - CRITICAL: Do this EVERY cycle
       - Try to maintain 2 food units in reserve
    
    6. Manage food supply:
       - Create Buy Request when food < 2 units
       - Accept any food offers at or below current market price
       - Reserve enough currency for 2 cycles of food
    
    SURVIVAL STRATEGIES:
